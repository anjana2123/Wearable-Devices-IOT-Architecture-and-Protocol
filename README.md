# Wearable-Devices-IOT-Architecture-and-Protocol
Wearable devices are parts of the essential cost
of goods sold (COGS) in the wheel of the Internet
of things (IoT), contributing to a potential impact in
the finance and banking sectors. There is a need for
lightweight cryptography mechanisms for IoT devices because these are resource constraints. —In this
digital world Internet of Things plays major role in
different fields. These IoT devices are extended from
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). s. The proposed
protocol allows the customer to buy the goods using
a wearable device and send the mobile application’s
confidential payment information. The application
creates a secure session between the customer, banks
and merchant. The static security analysis and informal security methods indicate that the proposed
protocol is withstanding the various security vulnerabilities involved in mobile payments. For logical
verification of the correctness of security properties
using the formal way of “Burrows-AbadiNeedham
(BAN)” logic confirms the proposed protocol’s accuracy. The practical simulation and validation using
the Scyther and Tamarin tool ensure that the absence of security attacks of our proposed framework.
Wearable technology adds to mobile technology to
offer higher efficiency and improve security in communication and payments. There is a demand for
designing the secure protocol for wearable device
environments. To answer this, we need an experience of digital payments through wearable devices; a
secure end-to-end micro payment protocol for wearable devices is introduced. NFC for device pairing
and a lightweight cryptography algorithm of ECC for
achieving security features are used.
